# getebook
## What?
Python package for building ebook files from books that are published as
webpages

## Why?
[Projekt Gutenberg-DE](http://gutenberg.spiegel.de) is a project that publishes
German books whose copyright has expired on the web, similar to
[Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org). *Unlike* Project Gutenberg, you
can not download the books in an ebook format. They are only published as
webpages. Hence, this package.
